An implementation of the Messagease keyboard layout.

## Comparison to the official app

|Official App|This App|
|-|-|
|Configurable within the app|No user configuration; configured with code|
|Has performance issues in general, and sometimes the interface lags out|Always snappy and instant|


## Notes

The app will ask for audio permissions when it starts up. This is just for voice input. If you don't want to use voice input you can just deny the permission.
